'''Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that prints the longest substring
of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order.
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your
program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring.
For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart.
