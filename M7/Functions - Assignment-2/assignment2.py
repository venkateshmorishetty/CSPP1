'''Assignment-2 - Paying Debt off in a Year'''

# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment
# needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months.
# By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change
# each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be
# paid each month.
#the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is
# made).
# The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months.
# Notice that it is possible for the balance to become
# negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:
# Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
# Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)
